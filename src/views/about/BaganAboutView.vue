            Located in Central Myanmar, only 4 hours away from Mandalay, Bagan is one of the world’s greatest
            archaeological sites. Visit this amazing historical town hosting more than 2,200 temples big and small. Set
            amongst thick greenery on the Ayeyarwady river basin with misty mountains at a distance, Bagan will surely
            enchant you with its mystical appearance. The temples rise above the canopy of trees, presenting a
            picture-perfect scenery to visitors.

            Bagan was the first capital of the Pagan Kingdom between the 9th to 13th centuries. More than 10,000
            Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed during the most flourishing days of the Kingdom
            between the 11th to 13th centuries. Today, around 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive and are carefully
            looked after by the government.

            The temples are a part of Bagan Archaeological Zone. They contain carvings, frescos and statues of Buddha,
            which are certainly mesmerising and fun to explore. Out of the 2,200 sites, only a few are regularly
            visited. Being the country’s foremost tourist destination, Bagan has innumerable licensed tourist transport
            services to help tourists enjoy this beautiful site.

            Apart from the temples, visitors can also enjoy a leisure trip on the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar’s lifeline.
            Take a cruise from Mandalay to Bagan and enjoy the riparian vegetation, the soothing river breeze and

            not to mention the sights and sounds of life along the river. You will also be able to indulge in the
            fascinating views of Mt. Sagaing, Pakokku, Myingyan and other sites along the way.
